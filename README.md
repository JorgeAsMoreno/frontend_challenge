# Frontend Technical Assessment
Welcome to FinSphera Frontend Technical Assessment. This is a challenge to evaluate your skills as a frontend developer. The challenge is divided in two parts, the development of a small application and the definition of a hypothetical architecture for a bigger one. The assessment is structured to give you the freedom to show your skills and creativity as a developer ðŸ§ .

## Part 1. Develop a small application.
 As a part of the challenge, you will be required to build some of the followings projects. ONLY ONE OF THEM.
1. A movie landing page that shows a list of movies and their details. You can use the movie database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to get the data or any other API of your preference.
Example:
![alt text](image.png)

The project should be built using React or Next.js and will have to follow the following aspects:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Built from scratch: You have the opportunity to create the repository from scratch or using a template, but the code should be yours. As a personal recommendation, I suggest using Vite.
3. Feel free to use any library or framework that you consider necessary to complete the project as well the CSS technology of your preference.
4. Implement the features that you consider necessary for the UI/UX.
5. Deploy the project on the platform of your choice, and finally give us the link to your public repository and of the deployed project.

> The assestment will have a limited time to be completed. I suggest to organize to complete the aspects to be evaluated over seek the perfect project. You can document the points that you would have added if you had more time.
